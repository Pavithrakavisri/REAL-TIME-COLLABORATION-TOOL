This project involves building a real-time collaborative platform that allows multiple users to work together simultaneously on shared content, such as code or notes. Using WebSockets, the tool provides instant updates across all connected clients without the need to refresh the page, mimicking tools like Google Docs or Live Share in VS Code.
The goal is to provide a seamless and interactive user experience where edits made by one user are reflected instantly for all others, enabling live teamwork.
